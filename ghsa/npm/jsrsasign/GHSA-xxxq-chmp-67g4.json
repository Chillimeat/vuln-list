    "Description": "### Impact\nJsrsasign supports RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 (i.e. RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5) encryption and decryption. Its encrypted message is represented as BigInteger. When there is a valid encrypted message, a crafted message with prepending zeros can be decrypted by this vulnerability.\n\n- If you don't use RSA PKCS#1 decryption, this vulnerability is not affected.\n- Risk to forge contents of encrypted message is very low.\n- Risk to raise memory corruption is low since jsrsasign uses BigInteger class.\n\n### Patches\nUsers using RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption should upgrade to 8.0.18.\n\n### Workarounds\nReject RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 encrypted message with unnecessary prepending zeros.",
