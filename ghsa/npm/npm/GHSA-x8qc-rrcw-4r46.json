    "Description": "## Arbitrary File Write\r\n\r\nVersions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Write. It fails to prevent access to folders outside of the intended `node_modules` folder through the `bin` field. A properly constructed entry in the package.json `bin` field would allow a package publisher to modify and/or gain access to arbitrary files on a userâ€™s system when the package is installed.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is possible through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the `--ignore-scripts` install option.\r\n\r\nThank you Daniel Ruf for reporting the issue!\r\n\r\nFurther information: [npm blog post](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/189618601100/binary-planting-with-the-npm-cli)\r\n",
