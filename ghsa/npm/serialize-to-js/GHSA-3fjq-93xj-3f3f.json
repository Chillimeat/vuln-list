    "Description": "## regular expressions Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability \r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). It does not properly mitigate against unsafe characters in serialized regular expressions.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is not affected on Node.js environment since Node.js's implementation of RegExp.prototype.toString() backslash-escapes all forward slashes in regular expressions.\r\n\r\nIf serialized data of regular expression objects are used in an environment other than Node.js, it is affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## Patches\r\n\r\nThis was patched in v3.0.1.\r\n\r\n",
