    "Description": "All versions of `socket.io-file` are vulnerable to Path Traversal. The package fails to sanitize user input and uses it to generate the file upload paths. The `socket.io-file::createFile` message contains a `name` option that is passed directly to `path.join()`.   It is possible to upload files to arbitrary folders on the server by sending relative paths on the `name` value, such as `../../test.js`.  The `uploadDir` and `rename` options can be used to define the file upload path.",
