    "Description": "There is a vulnerability in ActiveStorage's S3 adapter that allows the Content-Length of a\r\ndirect file upload to be modified by an end user.\r\n\r\nImpact\r\n------\r\n\r\nUtilizing this vulnerability, an attacker can control the Content-Length of an S3 direct upload URL without receiving a\r\nnew signature from the server. This could be used to bypass controls in place on the server to limit upload size.\r\n\r\nWorkarounds\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis is a low-severity security issue. As such, no workaround is necessarily\r\nuntil such time as the application can be upgraded.",
