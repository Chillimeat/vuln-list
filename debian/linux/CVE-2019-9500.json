  "description": "The Broadcom brcmfmac WiFi driver prior to commit 1b5e2423164b3670e8bc9174e4762d297990deff is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. If the Wake-up on Wireless LAN functionality is configured, a malicious event frame can be constructed to trigger an heap buffer overflow in the brcmf_wowl_nd_results function. This vulnerability can be exploited with compromised chipsets to compromise the host, or when used in combination with CVE-2019-9503, can be used remotely. In the worst case scenario, by sending specially-crafted WiFi packets, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. More typically, this vulnerability will result in denial-of-service conditions.",
