  "description": "A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in the Linux kernel, all versions 3.x.x and 4.x.x before 4.18.0, in Marvell WiFi chip driver. The flaw could occur when the station attempts a connection negotiation during the handling of the remote devices country settings. This could allow the remote device to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
