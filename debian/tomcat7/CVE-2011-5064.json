  "description": "DigestAuthenticator.java in the HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x before 7.0.12 uses Catalina as the hard-coded server secret (aka private key), which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of this string, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1184.",
