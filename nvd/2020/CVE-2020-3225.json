The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input processing of CIP traffic. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted CIP traffic to be processed by an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition."
