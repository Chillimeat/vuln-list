The vulnerability is due to the presence of a proxy service at a specific endpoint of the web UI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the proxy service. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass access restrictions on the network by proxying their access request through the management network of the affected device. As the proxy is reached over the management virtual routing and forwarding (VRF), this could reduce the effectiveness of the bypass."
