Product affected - All versions affected prior to Silver Peak Unity ECOS™ 8.3.2+, 8.1.9.12+ and Silver Peak Unity Orchestrator™ 8.9.2+ 1. Silver Peak product(s) Applicability 2. Unity EdgeConnect, NX, VX Applicable 3. Unity Orchestrator Applicable 4. EdgeConnect in AWS, Azure, GCP Applicable 5. Silver Peak Cloud Services Not Applicable Resolution • Changes have been made to strengthen the initial exchange between the EdgeConnect appliance and the Orchestrator. After the changes, EdgeConnect will validate the certificate used to identify the Orchestrator to EdgeConnect. • TLS itself is continually subject to newly discovered and exploitable vulnerabilities. As such, all versions of EdgeConnect software implement additional out-of-band and user-controlled authentication mechanisms. Any required configuration • Do not change Orchestrator’s IP address as discovered by the EdgeConnect appliance. • Upgrade to Silver Peak Unity ECOS™ 8.3.2+ or 8.1.9.12+ and Silver Peak Unity Orchestrator™ 8.9.2+. • In Orchestrator, enable the “Verify Orchestrator Certificate” option under Advanced Security Settings."
