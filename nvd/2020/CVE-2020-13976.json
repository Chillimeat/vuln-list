The Diagnostic page allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the host field of the ping command. Exploitation through CSRF might be possible. NOTE: software maintainers consider the report invalid because it refers to an old software version, requires administrative privileges, and does not provide access beyond that already available to administrative users."
