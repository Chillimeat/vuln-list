    "Description": "The (1) BMDMA and (2) AHCI HBA interfaces in the IDE functionality in QEMU 1.0 through 2.1.3 have multiple interpretations of a function's return value, which allows guest OS users to cause a host OS denial of service (memory consumption or infinite loop, and system crash) via a PRDT with zero complete sectors, related to the bmdma_prepare_buf and ahci_dma_prepare_buf functions.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3259\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in the qemu virtualisation\nsolution:\nIt was discovered that the IDE controller emulation is susceptible\n    to denial of service.\nDaniel P. Berrange discovered a denial of service vulnerability in\n    the VNC web socket decoder.\nJan Beulich discovered that unmediated PCI command register could\n    result in denial of service.\nJason Geffner discovered a buffer overflow in the emulated floppy\n    disk drive, resulting in the potential execution of arbitrary code.\n"
