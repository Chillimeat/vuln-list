      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3616\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\nIt was discovered that the snd_compress_check_input function used in\n    the ALSA subsystem does not properly check for an integer overflow,\n    allowing a local user to cause a denial of service.\nPengfei Wang discovered a race condition in the MIC VOP driver that\n    could allow a local user to obtain sensitive information from kernel\n    memory or cause a denial of service.\nCyril Bur and Michael Ellerman discovered a flaw in the handling of\n    Transactional Memory on powerpc systems allowing a local user to\n    cause a denial of service (kernel crash) or possibly have\n    unspecified other impact, by starting a transaction, suspending it,\n    and then calling any of the exec() class system calls.\nA heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the hiddev\n    driver, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service or,\n    potentially escalate their privileges.\nPengfei Wang discovered a flaw in the S/390 character device drivers\n    potentially leading to information leak with /dev/sclp.\nAdditionally this update fixes a regression in the ebtables facility\n(#828914) that was introduced in DSA-3607-1.\n"
