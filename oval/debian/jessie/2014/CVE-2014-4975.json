This could allow remote\n\tattackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or arbitrary code\n\texecution.\nThe REXML parser could be coerced into allocating large string\n\tobjects that could consume all available memory on the system. This\n\tcould allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash).\n"
