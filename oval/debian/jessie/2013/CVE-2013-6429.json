      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2857\nIt was discovered by the Spring development team that the fix for the\nXML External Entity (XXE) Injection \n(\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4152\"\u003e\\\nCVE-2013-4152\u003c/a\u003e) in the Spring Framework was incomplete.\nSpring MVC's SourceHttpMessageConverter also processed user provided XML\nand neither disabled XML external entities nor provided an option to\ndisable them. SourceHttpMessageConverter has been modified to provide an\noption to control the processing of XML external entities and that\nprocessing is now disabled by default.\nIn addition Jon Passki discovered a possible XSS vulnerability:\nThe JavaScriptUtils.javaScriptEscape() method did not escape all\ncharacters that are sensitive within either a JS single quoted string,\nJS double quoted string, or HTML script data context. In most cases this\nwill result in an unexploitable parse error but in some cases it could\nresult in an XSS vulnerability.\n"
