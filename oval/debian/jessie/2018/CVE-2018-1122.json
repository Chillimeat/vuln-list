If top were started from a directory writable\n    by the attacker (such as /tmp) this could result in local privilege\n    escalation.\nDenial of service against the ps invocation of another user.\nAn integer overflow in the file2strvec() function of libprocps could\n    result in local privilege escalation.\nA stack-based buffer overflow in pgrep could result in denial\n    of service for a user using pgrep for inspecting a specially\n    crafted process.\nIncorrect integer size parameters used in wrappers for standard C\n    allocators could cause integer truncation and lead to integer\n    overflow issues.\n"
