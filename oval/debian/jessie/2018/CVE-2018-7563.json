An attacker is able to create a malicious URL that, if opened by an authenticated user with debug privilege, will execute JavaScript code supplied by the attacker. The attacker-supplied code can perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing the victim's session token or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on the victim's behalf, and logging their keystrokes.",
