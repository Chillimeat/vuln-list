      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3597\nTwo related issues have been discovered in Expat, a C library for parsing\nXML.\nIt was introduced when \n    \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0876\"\u003eCVE-2012-0876\u003c/a\u003e \n    was addressed. Stefan SĂ¸rensen discovered that the use of the function \n    XML_Parse() seeds the random number generator generating repeated outputs \n    for rand() calls.\nIt is the product of an incomplete solution for \n    \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0876\"\u003eCVE-2012-0876\u003c/a\u003e. \n    The parser poorly seeds the random number generator allowing an attacker to \n    cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via an XML file with crafted \n    identifiers.\nYou might need to manually restart programs and services using expat\nlibraries.\n"
