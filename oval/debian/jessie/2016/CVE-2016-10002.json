    "Description": "Incorrect processing of responses to If-None-Modified HTTP conditional requests in Squid HTTP Proxy 3.1.10 through 3.1.23, 3.2.0.3 through 3.5.22, and 4.0.1 through 4.0.16 leads to client-specific Cookie data being leaked to other clients. Attack requests can easily be crafted by a client to probe a cache for this information.",
