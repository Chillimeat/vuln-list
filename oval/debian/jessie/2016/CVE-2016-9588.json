    "Description": "arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9 mismanages the #BP and #OF exceptions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) by declining to handle an exception thrown by an L2 guest.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3804\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or have other\nimpacts.\nJim Mattson discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel x86\n    processors does not properly handle #BP and #OF exceptions in an\n    L2 (nested) virtual machine. A local attacker in an L2 guest VM\n    can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service for\n    the L1 guest VM.\nAlexander Popov discovered a race condition flaw in the n_hdlc\n    line discipline that can lead to a double free. A local\n    unprivileged user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege\n    escalation. On systems that do not already have the n_hdlc module\n    loaded, this can be mitigated by disabling it:\n    \u003ccode\u003eecho \u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/disable-n_hdlc.conf install n_hdlc false\u003c/code\u003e\nGareth Evans reported that privileged users can map memory at\n    address 0 through the shmat() system call. This could make it\n    easier to exploit other kernel security vulnerabilities via a\n    set-UID program.\nAlexander Popov reported a race condition in the SCTP\n    implementation that can be used by local users to cause a\n    denial-of-service (crash). The initial fix for this was incorrect\n    and introduced further security issues (\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6353\"\u003e\n    CVE-2017-6353\u003c/a\u003e). This update includes a later fix that\n    avoids those. On systems that do not already have the sctp\n    module loaded, this can be mitigated by disabling it:\n    \u003ccode\u003eecho \u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/disable-sctp.conf install sctp false\u003c/code\u003e\nDmitry Vyukov reported a bug in the TCP implementation's handling\n    of urgent data in the splice() system call. This can be used by a\n    remote attacker for denial-of-service (hang) against applications\n    that read from TCP sockets with splice().\nAndrey Konovalov reported that the LLC type 2 implementation\n    incorrectly assigns socket buffer ownership. This can be used\n    by a local user to cause a denial-of-service (crash). On systems\n    that do not already have the llc2 module loaded, this can be\n    mitigated by disabling it:\n    \u003ccode\u003eecho \u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/disable-llc2.conf install llc2 false\u003c/code\u003e\nDmitry Vyukov reported a race condition in the raw packet (af_packet)\n    fanout feature. Local users with the CAP_NET_RAW capability (in any\n    user namespace) can use this for denial-of-service and possibly for\n    privilege escalation.\nDmitry Vyukov reported that the general queue implementation in\n    the IrDA subsystem does not properly manage multiple locks,\n    possibly allowing local users to cause a denial-of-service\n    (deadlock) via crafted operations on IrDA devices.\n"
