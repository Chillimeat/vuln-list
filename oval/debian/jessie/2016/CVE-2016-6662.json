    "Description": "Oracle MySQL through 5.5.52, 5.6.x through 5.6.33, and 5.7.x through 5.7.15; MariaDB before 5.5.51, 10.0.x before 10.0.27, and 10.1.x before 10.1.17; and Percona Server before 5.5.51-38.1, 5.6.x before 5.6.32-78.0, and 5.7.x before 5.7.14-7 allow local users to create arbitrary configurations and bypass certain protection mechanisms by setting general_log_file to a my.cnf configuration. NOTE: this can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code with root privileges by setting malloc_lib. NOTE: the affected MySQL version information is from Oracle's October 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that the issue was silently patched in MySQL 5.5.52, 5.6.33, and 5.7.15.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3666\nDawid Golunski discovered that the mysqld_safe wrapper provided by the\nMySQL database server insufficiently restricted the load path for custom\nmalloc implementations, which could result in privilege escalation.\nThe vulnerability was addressed by upgrading MySQL to the new upstream\nversion 5.5.52, which includes additional changes, such as performance\nimprovements, bug fixes, new features, and possibly incompatible\nchanges. Please see the MySQL 5.5 Release Notes for further details:\n"
