      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3758\nSeveral denial-of-service vulnerabilities (assertion failures) were\ndiscovered in BIND, a DNS server implementation.\nA crafted upstream response to an ANY query could cause an\n    assertion failure.\nA crafted upstream response with self-contradicting DNSSEC data\n    could cause an assertion failure.\nSpecially-crafted upstream responses with a DS record could cause\n    an assertion failure.\nThese vulnerabilities predominantly affect DNS servers providing\nrecursive service.  Client queries to authoritative-only servers\ncannot trigger these assertion failures.  These vulnerabilities are\npresent whether or not DNSSEC validation is enabled in the server\nconfiguration.\n"
