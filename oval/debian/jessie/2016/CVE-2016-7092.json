      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3663\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\nJeremie Boutoille of Quarkslab and Shangcong Luan of Alibaba\n    discovered a flaw in the handling of L3 pagetable entries, allowing\n    a malicious 32-bit PV guest administrator can escalate their\n    privilege to that of the host.\nx86 HVM guests running with shadow paging use a subset of the x86\n    emulator to handle the guest writing to its own pagetables. Andrew\n    Cooper of Citrix discovered that there are situations a guest can\n    provoke which result in exceeding the space allocated for internal\n    state. A malicious HVM guest administrator can cause Xen to fail a\n    bug check, causing a denial of service to the host.\nMikhail Gorobets of Advanced Threat Research, Intel Security\n    discovered a use after free flaw in the FIFO event channel code. A\n    malicious guest administrator can crash the host, leading to a\n    denial of service. Arbitrary code execution (and therefore privilege\n    escalation), and information leaks, cannot be excluded.\n"
