Additional information can be found at\n    \u003ca href=\"https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2016/06/27/undefined-pointer-arithmetic/\"\u003e\n    https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2016/06/27/undefined-pointer-arithmetic/\u003c/a\u003e\nCesar Pereida, Billy Brumley and Yuval Yarom discovered a timing\n    leak in the DSA code.\nQuan Luo and the OCAP audit team discovered denial of service\n    vulnerabilities in DTLS.\nShi Lei discovered an out-of-bounds memory read in\n    TS_OBJ_print_bio() and an out-of-bounds write in BN_bn2dec()\n    and MDC2_Update().\nDES-based cipher suites are demoted from the HIGH group to MEDIUM\n    as a mitigation for the SWEET32 attack.\nShi Lei discovered that the use of SHA512 in TLS session tickets\n    is susceptible to denial of service.\nShi Lei discovered that excessively large OCSP status request may\n    result in denial of service via memory exhaustion.\nShi Lei discovered that missing message length validation when parsing\n    certificates may potentially result in denial of service.\n"
