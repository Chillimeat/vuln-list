An attacker who obtains 4640 bits from the RNG can\ntrivially predict the next 160 bits of output.\nA first analysis on the impact of this bug for GnuPG shows that existing\nRSA keys are not weakened. For DSA and Elgamal keys it is also unlikely\nthat the private key can be predicted from other public information.\nDSA-3650\nFelix Doerre and Vladimir Klebanov from the Karlsruhe Institute of\nTechnology discovered a flaw in the mixing functions of Libgcrypt's\nrandom number generator.
