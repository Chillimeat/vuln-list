An\n    attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause an application\n    crash (denial-of-service), or potentially to execute arbitrary code\n    with the privileges of the user running MuPDF, if a specially\n    crafted PDF file is processed.\nYu Hong and Zheng Jihong discovered a heap overflow vulnerability\n    within the pdf_load_mesh_params function, allowing an attacker to\n    cause an application crash (denial-of-service), or potentially to\n    execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\n    MuPDF, if a specially crafted PDF file is processed.\n"
