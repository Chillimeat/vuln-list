      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3835\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python\nweb development framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nMarti Raudsepp reported that a user with a hardcoded password is\n    created when running tests with an Oracle database.\nAymeric Augustin discovered that Django does not properly validate\n    the Host header against settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS when the debug\n    setting is enabled. A remote attacker can take advantage of this\n    flaw to perform DNS rebinding attacks.\nIt was discovered that is_safe_url() does not properly handle\n    certain numeric URLs as safe. A remote attacker can take advantage\n    of this flaw to perform XSS attacks or to use a Django server as an\n    open redirect.\nPhithon from Chaitin Tech discovered an open redirect vulnerability\n    in the django.views.static.serve() view. Note that this view is not\n    intended for production use.\n"
