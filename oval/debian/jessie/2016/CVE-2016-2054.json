    "Description": "Multiple buffer overflows in xymond/xymond.c in xymond in Xymon 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and 4.3.x before 4.3.25 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a long filename, involving handling a \"config\" command.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3495\nMarkus Krell discovered that xymon, a network- and\napplications-monitoring system, was vulnerable to the following\nsecurity issues:\nThe incorrect handling of user-supplied input in the \u003cq\u003econfig\u003c/q\u003e\n  command can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in\n  denial of service (via application crash) or remote code execution.\nThe incorrect handling of user-supplied input in the \u003cq\u003econfig\u003c/q\u003e\n  command can lead to an information leak by serving sensitive\n  configuration files to a remote user.\nThe commands handling password management do not properly validate\n  user-supplied input, and are thus vulnerable to shell command\n  injection by a remote user.\nIncorrect permissions on an internal queuing system allow a user\n  with a local account on the xymon master server to bypass all\n  network-based access control lists, and thus inject messages\n  directly into xymon.\nIncorrect escaping of user-supplied input in status webpages can\n  be used to trigger reflected cross-site scripting attacks.\n"
