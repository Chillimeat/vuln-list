    "Description": "The xrstor function in arch/x86/xstate.c in Xen 4.x does not properly handle writes to the hardware FSW.ES bit when running on AMD64 processors, which allows local guest OS users to obtain sensitive register content information from another guest by leveraging pending exception and mask bits.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2013-2076.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3554\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\nJan Beulich from SUSE discovered that Xen does not properly handle\n    writes to the hardware FSW.ES bit when running on AMD64 processors.\n    A malicious domain can take advantage of this flaw to obtain address\n    space usage and timing information, about another domain, at a\n    fairly low rate.\nLing Liu and Yihan Lian of the Cloud Security Team, Qihoo 360\n    discovered an integer overflow in the x86 shadow pagetable code. A\n    HVM guest using shadow pagetables can cause the host to crash. A PV\n    guest using shadow pagetables (i.e. being migrated) with PV\n    superpages enabled (which is not the default) can crash the host, or\n    corrupt hypervisor memory, potentially leading to privilege\n    escalation.\n"
