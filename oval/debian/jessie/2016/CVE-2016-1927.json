    "Description": "The suggestPassword function in js/functions.js in phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.13, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.3, and 4.5.x before 4.5.4 relies on the Math.random JavaScript function, which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess passwords via a brute-force approach.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3627\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been fixed in phpMyAdmin, the web-based\nMySQL administration interface.\nThe suggestPassword function relied on a non-secure random number\n    generator which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess\n    generated passwords via a brute-force approach.\nCSRF token values were generated by a non-secure random number\n    generator, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access\n    restrictions by predicting a value.\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote\n    authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\nphpMyAdmin does not use a constant-time algorithm for comparing\n    CSRF tokens, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass\n    intended access restrictions by measuring time differences.\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote\n    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote\n    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote\n    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\nFor installations running on plain HTTP, phpMyAdmin allows remote\n    attackers to conduct BBCode injection attacks against HTTP sessions\n    via a crafted URI.\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote\n    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\nphpMyAdmin allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n    (resource consumption) via a large array in the scripts parameter.\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows remote\n    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote\n    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\nA specially crafted Transformation could leak information which\n    a remote attacker could use to perform cross site request forgeries.\n"
