    "Description": "Double free vulnerability in the jas_iccattrval_destroy function in JasPer 1.900.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted ICC color profile in a JPEG 2000 image file, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-8137.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3508\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in JasPer, a library for\nmanipulating JPEG-2000 files. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nJacob Baines discovered a double-free flaw in the\n    jas_iccattrval_destroy function. A remote attacker could exploit\n    this flaw to cause an application using the JasPer library to crash,\n    or potentially, to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\n    user running the application.\nThe Qihoo 360 Codesafe Team discovered a NULL pointer dereference\n    flaw within the jas_matrix_clip function. A remote attacker could\n    exploit this flaw to cause an application using the JasPer library\n    to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service.\nTyler Hicks discovered a memory leak flaw in the\n    jas_iccprof_createfrombuf function. A remote attacker could exploit\n    this flaw to cause the JasPer library to consume memory, resulting\n    in a denial-of-service.\n"
