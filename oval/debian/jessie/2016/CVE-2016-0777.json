    "Description": "The resend_bytes function in roaming_common.c in the client in OpenSSH 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x before 7.1p2 allows remote servers to obtain sensitive information from process memory by requesting transmission of an entire buffer, as demonstrated by reading a private key.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3446\nThe Qualys Security team discovered two vulnerabilities in the roaming\ncode of the OpenSSH client (an implementation of the SSH protocol\nsuite).\nSSH roaming enables a client, in case an SSH connection breaks\nunexpectedly, to resume it at a later time, provided the server also\nsupports it.\nThe OpenSSH server doesn't support roaming, but the OpenSSH client\nsupports it (even though it's not documented) and it's enabled by\ndefault.\nAn information leak (memory disclosure) can be exploited by a rogue\n    SSH server to trick a client into leaking sensitive data from the\n    client memory, including for example private keys.\nA buffer overflow (leading to file descriptor leak), can also be\n    exploited by a rogue SSH server, but due to another bug in the code\n    is possibly not exploitable, and only under certain conditions (not\n    the default configuration), when using ProxyCommand, ForwardAgent or\n    ForwardX11.\nThis security update completely disables the roaming code in the OpenSSH\nclient.\nIt is also possible to disable roaming by adding the (undocumented)\noption \u003cq\u003eUseRoaming no\u003c/q\u003e to the global /etc/ssh/ssh_config file, or to the\nuser configuration in ~/.ssh/config, or by passing -oUseRoaming=no on\nthe command line.\nUsers with passphrase-less private keys, especially in non interactive\nsetups (automated jobs using ssh, scp, rsync+ssh etc.) are advised to\nupdate their keys if they have connected to an SSH server they don't\ntrust.\nMore details about identifying an attack and mitigations will be\navailable in the Qualys Security Advisory.\n"
