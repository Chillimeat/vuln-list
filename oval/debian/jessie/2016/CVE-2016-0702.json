    "Description": "The MOD_EXP_CTIME_COPY_FROM_PREBUF function in crypto/bn/bn_exp.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g does not properly consider cache-bank access times during modular exponentiation, which makes it easier for local users to discover RSA keys by running a crafted application on the same Intel Sandy Bridge CPU core as a victim and leveraging cache-bank conflicts, aka a \"CacheBleed\" attack.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3500\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure Socket Layer\ntoolkit.\nYuval Yarom from the University of Adelaide and NICTA, Daniel Genkin\n    from Technion and Tel Aviv University, and Nadia Heninger from the\n    University of Pennsylvania discovered a side-channel attack which\n    makes use of cache-bank conflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge\n    microarchitecture. This could allow local attackers to recover RSA\n    private keys.\nAdam Langley from Google discovered a double free bug when parsing\n    malformed DSA private keys. This could allow remote attackers to\n    cause a denial of service or memory corruption in applications\n    parsing DSA private keys received from untrusted sources.\nGuido Vranken discovered an integer overflow in the BN_hex2bn and\n    BN_dec2bn functions that can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and\n    heap corruption. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial\n    of service or memory corruption in applications processing hex or\n    dec data received from untrusted sources.\nEmilia KĂ¤sper of the OpenSSL development team discovered a memory\n    leak in the SRP database lookup code. To mitigate the memory leak,\n    the seed handling in SRP_VBASE_get_by_user is now disabled even if\n    the user has configured a seed. Applications are advised to migrate\n    to the SRP_VBASE_get1_by_user function.\nGuido Vranken discovered an integer overflow in the BIO_*printf\n    functions that could lead to an OOB read when printing very long\n    strings. Additionally the internal doapr_outch function can attempt\n    to write to an arbitrary memory location in the event of a memory\n    allocation failure. These issues will only occur on platforms where\n    sizeof(size_t) \u003e sizeof(int) like many 64 bit systems. This could\n    allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or memory\n    corruption in applications that pass large amounts of untrusted data\n    to the BIO_*printf functions.\nAdditionally the EXPORT and LOW ciphers were disabled since thay could\nbe used as part of the DROWN\n(\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0800\"\u003eCVE-2016-0800\u003c/a\u003e)\nand SLOTH\n(\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7575\"\u003eCVE-2015-7575\u003c/a\u003e)\nattacks, but note that the oldstable (wheezy) and stable (jessie)\ndistributions are not affected by those attacks since the SSLv2 protocol\nhas already been dropped in the openssl package version 1.0.0c-2.\n"
