    "Description": "The smartcard interaction in SPICE allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (QEMU-KVM process crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to connecting to a guest VM, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3596\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in spice, a SPICE protocol\nclient and server library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nJing Zhao of Red Hat discovered a memory allocation flaw, leading to\n    a heap-based buffer overflow in spice's smartcard interaction. A\n    user connecting to a guest VM via spice can take advantage of this\n    flaw to cause a denial-of-service (QEMU process crash), or\n    potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the\n    privileges of the hosting QEMU process.\nFrediano Ziglio of Red Hat discovered that a malicious guest inside\n    a virtual machine can take control of the corresponding QEMU process\n    in the host using crafted primary surface parameters.\n"
