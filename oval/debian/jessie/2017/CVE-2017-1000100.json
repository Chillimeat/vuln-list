      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3992\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer\nlibrary. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\nEven Rouault reported that cURL does not properly handle long file\n    names when doing an TFTP upload. A malicious HTTP(S) server can take\n    advantage of this flaw by redirecting a client using the cURL\n    library to a crafted TFTP URL and trick it to send private memory\n    contents to a remote server over UDP.\nBrian Carpenter and Yongji Ouyang reported that cURL contains a flaw\n    in the globbing function that parses the numerical range, leading to\n    an out-of-bounds read when parsing a specially crafted URL.\nMax Dymond reported that cURL contains an out-of-bounds read flaw in\n    the FTP PWD response parser. A malicious server can take advantage\n    of this flaw to effectively prevent a client using the cURL library\n    to work with it, causing a denial of service.\n"
