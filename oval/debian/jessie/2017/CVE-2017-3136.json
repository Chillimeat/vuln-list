      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3854\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server\nimplementation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nOleg Gorokhov of Yandex discovered that BIND does not properly\n    handle certain queries when using DNS64 with the \"break-dnssec yes;\"\n    option, allowing a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service.\nIt was discovered that BIND makes incorrect assumptions about the\n    ordering of records in the answer section of a response containing\n    CNAME or DNAME resource records, leading to situations where BIND\n    exits with an assertion failure. An attacker can take advantage of\n    this condition to cause a denial-of-service.\nMike Lalumiere of Dyn, Inc. discovered that BIND can exit with a\n    REQUIRE assertion failure if it receives a null command string on\n    its control channel. Note that the fix applied in Debian is only\n    applied as a hardening measure.
