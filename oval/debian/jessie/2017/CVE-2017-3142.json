They allow an attacker to bypass TSIG authentication by\nsending crafted DNS packets to a server.\nAn attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative\n    DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name may be able to\n    circumvent TSIG authentication of AXFR requests via a carefully constructed\n    request packet. A server that relies solely on TSIG keys for protection\n    with no other ACL protection could be manipulated into:\n\t\nAn attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative\n    DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name for the zone and\n    service being targeted may be able to manipulate BIND into accepting an\n    unauthorized dynamic update. \n"
