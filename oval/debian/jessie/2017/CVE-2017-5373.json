With the removing of the Debian branding the packages\nare also renamed back to the official names used by Mozilla.\nThe Thunderbird package is using a different default profile folder,\nthe default profile folder is now \u003ccode\u003e'\\$(HOME)/.thunderbird'\u003c/code\u003e.\nThe users profile folder, that was used in Icedove, will get migrated\nto the new profile folder on the first start, that can take a little bit\nmore time.\nPlease read README.Debian for getting more information about the\nchanges.\n"
