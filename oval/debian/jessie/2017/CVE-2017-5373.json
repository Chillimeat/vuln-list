    "Description": "Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 50.1 and Firefox ESR 45.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 45.7, Firefox ESR \u003c 45.7, and Firefox \u003c 51.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3771\nMultiple security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web\nbrowser: Memory safety errors, use-after-frees and other implementation\nerrors may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, information\ndisclosure or privilege escalation.\nDSA-3832\nMultiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird, which may may\nlead to the execution of arbitrary code or information leaks.\nWith this update, the Icedove packages are de-branded back to the official\nMozilla branding. With the removing of the Debian branding the packages\nare also renamed back to the official names used by Mozilla.\nThe Thunderbird package is using a different default profile folder,\nthe default profile folder is now \u003ccode\u003e'\\$(HOME)/.thunderbird'\u003c/code\u003e.\nThe users profile folder, that was used in Icedove, will get migrated\nto the new profile folder on the first start, that can take a little bit\nmore time.\nPlease read README.Debian for getting more information about the\nchanges.\n"
