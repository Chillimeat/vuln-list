The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing issues:\nAleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos and \u003cq\u003eflxflndy\u003c/q\u003e discovered that\n    Dovecot does not properly parse invalid email addresses, which may\n    cause a crash or leak memory contents to an attacker.\nIt was discovered that TLS SNI config lookups may lead to excessive\n    memory usage, causing imap-login/pop3-login VSZ limit to be reached\n    and the process restarted, resulting in a denial of service. Only\n    Dovecot configurations containing \u003ccode\u003elocal_name { }\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003elocal { }\u003c/code\u003e\n    configuration blocks are affected.\nIt was discovered that Dovecot contains a memory leak flaw in the\n    login process on aborted SASL authentication.\n"
