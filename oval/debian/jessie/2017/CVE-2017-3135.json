It\nis uncommon for both of these options to be used in combination, so\nvery few systems will be affected by this problem in practice.\nThis update also corrects an additional regression caused by the fix\nfor \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8864\"\u003eCVE-2016-8864\u003c/a\u003e,\nwhich was applied in a previous security update.\n"
