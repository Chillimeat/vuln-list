      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3942\nCalum Hutton reported that the XML-RPC server in supervisor, a system\nfor controlling process state, does not perform validation on requested\nXML-RPC methods, allowing an authenticated client to send a malicious\nXML-RPC request to supervisord that will run arbitrary shell commands on\nthe server as the same user as supervisord.\nThe vulnerability has been fixed by disabling nested namespace lookup\nentirely. supervisord will now only call methods on the object\nregistered to handle XML-RPC requests and not any child objects it may\ncontain, possibly breaking existing setups. No publicly available\nplugins are currently known that use nested namespaces. Plugins that use\na single namespace will continue to work as before. Details can be found\non the upstream issue at\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964\"\u003ehttps://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964\u003c/a\u003e .\n"
