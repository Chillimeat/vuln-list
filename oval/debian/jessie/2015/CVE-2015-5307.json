    "Description": "The KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.2.6, and Xen 4.3.x through 4.6.x, allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS panic or hang) by triggering many #AC (aka Alignment Check) exceptions, related to svm.c and vmx.c.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3454\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in VirtualBox, an x86\nvirtualisation solution.\nUpstream support for the 4.1 release series has ended and since no\ninformation is available which would allow backports of isolated security\nfixes, security support for virtualbox in wheezy/oldstable needed to be\nended as well.\nIf you use virtualbox with externally procured VMs (e.g. through vagrant)\nwe advise you to update to Debian jessie.\nDSA-3396\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a denial of service.\nBen Serebrin from Google discovered a guest to host denial of\n    service flaw affecting the KVM hypervisor. A malicious guest can\n    trigger an infinite stream of \u003cq\u003ealignment check\u003c/q\u003e (#AC) exceptions\n    causing the processor microcode to enter an infinite loop where the\n    core never receives another interrupt. This leads to a panic of the\n    host kernel.\nSergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke and Ralf Spenneberg discovered a\n    flaw in the processing of certain USB device descriptors in the\n    usbvision driver. An attacker with physical access to the system can\n    use this flaw to crash the system.\nDmitry Vyukov discovered a vulnerability in the keyrings garbage\n    collector allowing a local user to trigger a kernel panic.\nIt was discovered that the fix for \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6937\"\u003eCVE-2015-6937\u003c/a\u003e was incomplete. A\n    race condition when sending a message on unbound socket can still\n    cause a NULL pointer dereference. A remote attacker might be able to\n    cause a denial of service (crash) by sending a crafted packet.\n"
