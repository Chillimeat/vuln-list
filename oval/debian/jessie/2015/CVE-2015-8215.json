      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3364\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation or denial of service.\nIt was discovered that NetworkManager would set IPv6 MTUs based on\n    the values received in IPv6 RAs (Router Advertisements), without\n    sufficiently validating these values. A remote attacker could\n    exploit this attack to disable IPv6 connectivity. This has been\n    mitigated by adding validation in the kernel.\nJann Horn discovered that when a subdirectory of a filesystem is\n    bind-mounted into a container that has its own user and mount\n    namespaces, a process with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in the user\n    namespace can access files outside of the subdirectory.  The\n    default Debian configuration mitigated this as it does not allow\n    unprivileged users to create new user namespaces.\nJason Wang discovered that when a virtio_net device is connected\n    to a bridge in the same VM, a series of TCP packets forwarded\n    through the bridge may cause a heap buffer overflow.  A remote\n    attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or\n    possibly for privilege escalation.\nMichael S. Tsirkin of Red Hat Engineering found that the vhost\n    driver leaked file descriptors passed to it with the\n    VHOST_SET_LOG_FD ioctl command. A privileged local user with access\n    to the /dev/vhost-net file, either directly or via libvirt, could\n    use this to cause a denial of service (hang or crash).\nIt was found that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol\n    implementation did not verify that an underlying transport exists\n    when creating a connection.  Depending on how a local RDS\n    application initialised its sockets, a remote attacker might be\n    able to cause a denial of service (crash) by sending a crafted\n    packet.\nXavier Chantry discovered that the patch provided by the aufs\n    project to correct behaviour of memory-mapped files from an aufs\n    mount introduced a race condition in the msync() system call.\n    Ben Hutchings found that it also introduced a similar bug in the\n    madvise_remove() function.  A local attacker could use this to\n    cause a denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.\n"
