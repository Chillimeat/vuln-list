    "Description": "The session backends in Django before 1.4.21, 1.5.x through 1.6.x, 1.7.x before 1.7.9, and 1.8.x before 1.8.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (session store consumption) via multiple requests with unique session keys.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3305\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python\nweb development framework:\nEric Peterson and Lin Hua Cheng discovered that a new empty record\n    used to be created in the session storage every time a session was\n    accessed and an unknown session key was provided in the request\n    cookie. This could allow remote attackers to saturate the session\n    store or cause other users' session records to be evicted.\nSjoerd Job Postmus discovered that some built-in validators did not\n    properly reject newlines in input values. This could allow remote\n    attackers to inject headers in emails and HTTP responses.\n"
