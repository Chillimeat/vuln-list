    "Description": "db.c in named in ISC BIND 9.x before 9.9.8-P2 and 9.10.x before 9.10.3-P2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (REQUIRE assertion failure and daemon exit) via a malformed class attribute.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3420\nIt was discovered that the BIND DNS server does not properly handle the\nparsing of incoming responses, allowing some records with an incorrect\nclass to be accepted by BIND instead of being rejected as malformed.\nThis can trigger a REQUIRE assertion failure when those records are\nsubsequently cached. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to cause a\ndenial of service against servers performing recursive queries.\n"
