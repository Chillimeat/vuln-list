      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3471\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a full virtualization\nsolution on x86 hardware.\nJason Wang of Red Hat Inc. discovered that the Virtual Network\n    Device support is vulnerable to denial-of-service, that could\n    occur when receiving large packets.\nQinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. and Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc.\n    discovered that the PC-Net II ethernet controller is vulnerable to\n    a heap-based buffer overflow that could result in\n    denial-of-service (via application crash) or arbitrary code\n    execution.\nLing Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. and Jason Wang of Red Hat Inc.\n    discovered that the PC-Net II ethernet controller is vulnerable to\n    a buffer overflow that could result in denial-of-service (via\n    application crash) or arbitrary code execution.\nQinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. and Ling Liu of Qihoo 360\n    Inc. discovered that the PCI MSI-X emulator is vulnerable to a\n    null pointer dereference issue, that could lead to\n    denial-of-service (via application crash).\nQinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the eepro100\n    emulator contains a flaw that could lead to an infinite loop when\n    processing Command Blocks, eventually resulting in\n    denial-of-service (via application crash).\nLian Yihan of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the VNC display\n    driver support is vulnerable to an arithmetic exception flaw that\n    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash).\nFelix Wilhelm of ERNW Research discovered that the PV backend drivers are\n    vulnerable to double fetch vulnerabilities, possibly resulting in\n    arbitrary code execution.\nQinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the USB EHCI\n    emulation support contains a flaw that could lead to an infinite\n    loop during communication between the host controller and a device\n    driver. This could lead to denial-of-service (via resource\n    exhaustion).\nQinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the vmxnet3 device\n    emulator could be used to intentionally leak host memory, thus\n    resulting in denial-of-service.\nQinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the SCSI MegaRAID\n    SAS HBA emulation support is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer\n    overflow issue, that could lead to denial-of-service (via\n    application crash).\nLing Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the Human Monitor\n    Interface support is vulnerable to an out-of-bound write access\n    issue that could result in denial-of-service (via application\n    crash).\nLing Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the NE2000 emulator is\n    vulnerable to an out-of-bound read/write access issue, potentially\n    resulting in information leak or memory corruption.\nThe vmxnet3 driver incorrectly processes small packets, which could\n   result in denial-of-service (via application crash).\nThe vmxnet3 driver incorrectly processes Interrupt Mask Registers,\n   which could result in denial-of-service (via application crash).\nQinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the IDE AHCI\n    emulation support is vulnerable to a use-after-free issue, that\n    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash) or\n    arbitrary code execution.\nDonghai Zhu of Alibaba discovered that the Firmware Configuration\n    emulation support is vulnerable to an out-of-bound read/write\n    access issue, that could lead to denial-of-service (via\n    application crash) or arbitrary code execution.\nLing Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that 32-bit Windows guests\n    support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference issue, that\n    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash).\nThe e1000 driver is vulnerable to an infinite loop issue that\n    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash).\n"
