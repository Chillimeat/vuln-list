    "Description": "The phar_get_entry_data function in ext/phar/util.c in PHP before 5.5.30 and 5.6.x before 5.6.14 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a .phar file with a crafted TAR archive entry in which the Link indicator references a file that does not exist.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3380\nTwo vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting\nlanguage commonly used for web application development.\nThe phar extension could crash with a NULL pointer dereference\n    when processing tar archives containing links referring to\n    non-existing files. This could lead to a denial of service.\nThe phar extension does not correctly process directory entries\n    found in archive files with the name \"/\", leading to a denial of\n    service and, potentially, information disclosure.\nThe update for Debian stable (jessie) contains additional bug fixes\nfrom PHP upstream version 5.6.14, as described in the upstream\nchangelog:\nNote to users of the oldstable distribution (wheezy): PHP 5.4 has\nreached end-of-life on September 14th, 2015.  As a result, there will\nbe no more new upstream releases. The security support of PHP 5.4 in\nDebian oldstable (wheezy) will be best effort only, and you are\nstrongly advised to upgrade to latest Debian stable release (jessie),\nwhich includes PHP 5.6.\n"
