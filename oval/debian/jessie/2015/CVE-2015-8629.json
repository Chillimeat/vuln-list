    "Description": "The xdr_nullstring function in lib/kadm5/kadm_rpc_xdr.c in kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.13.4 and 1.14.x before 1.14.1 does not verify whether '\\0' characters exist as expected, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted string.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3466\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in krb5, the MIT implementation\nof Kerberos. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\nIt was discovered that an authenticated attacker can cause kadmind\n    to read beyond the end of allocated memory by sending a string\n    without a terminating zero byte. Information leakage may be possible\n    for an attacker with permission to modify the database.\nIt was discovered that an authenticated attacker with permission to\n    modify a principal entry can cause kadmind to dereference a null\n    pointer by supplying a null policy value but including KADM5_POLICY\n    in the mask.\nIt was discovered that an authenticated attacker can cause kadmind\n    to leak memory by supplying a null principal name in a request which\n    uses one. Repeating these requests will eventually cause kadmind to\n    exhaust all available memory.\n"
