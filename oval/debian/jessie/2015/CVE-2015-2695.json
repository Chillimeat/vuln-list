The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\nIt was discovered that applications which call gss_inquire_context()\n    on a partially-established SPNEGO context can cause the GSS-API\n    library to read from a pointer using the wrong type, leading to a\n    process crash.\nIt was discovered that applications which call gss_inquire_context()\n    on a partially-established IAKERB context can cause the GSS-API\n    library to read from a pointer using the wrong type, leading to a\n    process crash.\nIt was discovered that the build_principal_va() function incorrectly\n    handles input strings. An authenticated attacker can take advantage\n    of this flaw to cause a KDC to crash using a TGS request with a\n    large realm field beginning with a null byte.\n"
