      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3633\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\nJulien Grall discovered that Xen on ARM was susceptible to denial\n    of service via long running memory operations.\nJan Beulich discovered that incorrect page table handling could\n    result in privilege escalation inside a Xen guest instance.\nWei Liu discovered multiple cases of missing input sanitising in\n    libxl which could result in denial of service.\nAaron Cornelius discovered that incorrect resource handling on\n    ARM systems could result in denial of service.\nJeremie Boutoille discovered that incorrect pagetable handling in\n    PV instances could result in guest to host privilege escalation.\n"
