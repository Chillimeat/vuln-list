    "Description": "The rfcomm_sock_bind function in net/bluetooth/rfcomm/sock.c in the Linux kernel before 4.2 allows local users to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via vectors involving a bind system call on a Bluetooth RFCOMM socket.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3696\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\nIt was discovered that missing input sanitising in RFCOMM Bluetooth\n    socket handling may result in denial of service or information leak.\nIt was discovered that a race condition in the memory management\n    code can be used for local privilege escalation.\nOndrej Kozina discovered that incorrect buffer allocation in the\n    proc_keys_show() function may result in local denial of service.\nMarco Grassi discovered a buffer overflow in the arcmsr SCSI driver\n    which may result in local denial of service, or potentially,\n    arbitrary code execution.\nAdditionally this update fixes a regression introduced in DSA-3616-1\ncausing iptables performance issues (cf. Debian Bug #831014).\n"
