    "Description": "The tcp_request function in Dnsmasq before 2.73rc4 does not properly handle the return value of the setup_reply function, which allows remote attackers to read process memory and cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) via a malformed DNS request.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3251\nNick Sampanis discovered that dnsmasq, a small caching DNS proxy and\nDHCP/TFTP server, did not properly check the return value of the\nsetup_reply() function called during a TCP connection, which is used\nthen as a size argument in a function which writes data on the client's\nconnection. A remote attacker could exploit this issue via a specially\ncrafted DNS request to cause dnsmasq to crash, or potentially to obtain\nsensitive information from process memory.\n"
