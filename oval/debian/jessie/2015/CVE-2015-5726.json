    "Description": "The BER decoder in Botan 0.10.x before 1.10.10 and 1.11.x before 1.11.19 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via an empty BIT STRING in ASN.1 data.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3565\nSeveral security vulnerabilities were found in botan1.10, a C++\nlibrary which provides support for many common cryptographic\noperations, including encryption, authentication, X.509v3 certificates\nand CRLs.\nThe BER decoder would crash due to reading from offset 0 of an\n    empty vector if it encountered a BIT STRING which did not contain\n    any data at all. This can be used to easily crash applications\n    reading untrusted ASN.1 data, but does not seem exploitable for\n    code execution.\nThe BER decoder would allocate a fairly arbitrary amount of memory\n    in a length field, even if there was no chance the read request\n    would succeed. This might cause the process to run out of memory or\n    invoke the OOM killer.\nUse constant time PKCS #1 unpadding to avoid possible side channel\n    attack against RSA decryption\nInfinite loop in modular square root algorithm.\n    The ressol function implementing the Tonelli-Shanks algorithm for\n    finding square roots could be sent into a nearly infinite loop due\n    to a misplaced conditional check. This could occur if a composite\n    modulus is provided, as this algorithm is only defined for primes.\n    This function is exposed to attacker controlled input via the\n    OS2ECP function during ECC point decompression.\nFix Heap overflow on invalid ECC point.\nUse constant time modular inverse algorithm to avoid possible\n    side channel attack against ECDSA.\n"
