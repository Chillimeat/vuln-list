    "Description": "Buffer overflow in the png_set_PLTE function in libpng before 1.0.65, 1.1.x and 1.2.x before 1.2.55, 1.3.x, 1.4.x before 1.4.18, 1.5.x before 1.5.25, and 1.6.x before 1.6.20 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a small bit-depth value in an IHDR (aka image header) chunk in a PNG image.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-8126.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3443\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the libpng PNG library.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\nIt was discovered that the original fix for\n    \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8126\"\u003e\\\n    CVE-2015-8126\u003c/a\u003e was\n    incomplete and did not detect a potential overrun by applications\n    using png_set_PLTE directly. A remote attacker can take advantage of\n    this flaw to cause a denial of service (application crash).\nXiao Qixue and Chen Yu discovered a flaw in the png_check_keyword\n    function. A remote attacker can potentially take advantage of this\n    flaw to cause a denial of service (application crash).\n"
