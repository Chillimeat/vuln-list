  "Description": "An attacker with enough privileges to change the hostname might be able to disclose uninitialized memory. This issue also affects the Authoritative Server and dnsdist; since the attack requires very high privileges and the issue does not affect Linux, we will not be releasing new versions for those just for this issue. Severity is low.",
