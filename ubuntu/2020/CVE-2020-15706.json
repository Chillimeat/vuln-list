  "Description": "grub2 contains a use-after-free vulnerability which can be triggered by redefining a function whilst the same function is already executing.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "Chris Coulson discovered that the GRUB2 function handling code did not properly handle a function being redefined, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.",
  "Notes": [
    "amurray| grub2-signed is not supported in Ubuntu 12.04 ESM (precise/esm) and so marking the priority for grub2 in this release as low",
