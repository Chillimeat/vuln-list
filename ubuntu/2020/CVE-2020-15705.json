  "Description": "grub2 fails to validate kernel signature when booted directly without shim, allowing secure boot to be bypassed. This only affects systems where the kernel signing certificate has been imported directly into the secure boot database and the grub image is booted directly without the use of shim.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "Mathieu Trudel-Lapierre discovered that in certain situations, GRUB2 failed to validate kernel signatures. A local attacker could use this to bypass Secure Boot restrictions.",
  "Notes": [
    "amurray| grub2-signed is not supported in Ubuntu 12.04 ESM (precise/esm) and so marking the priority for grub2 in this release as low"
