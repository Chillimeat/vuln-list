  "References": [
    "https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1945"
  ],
  "Description": "Apache Ant 1.1 to 1.9.14 and 1.10.0 to 1.10.7 uses the default temporary directory identified by the Java system property java.io.tmpdir for several tasks and may thus leak sensitive information. The fixcrlf and replaceregexp tasks also copy files from the temporary directory back into the build tree allowing an attacker to inject modified source files into the build process.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "It was discovered that Apache Ant created temporary files with insecure permissions. An attacker could use this vulnerability to read sensitive information leaked into /tmp, or potentially inject malicious code into a project that is built with Apache Ant.",
