  "Description": "Integer overflows were discovered in the functions grub_cmd_initrd and grub_initrd_init in the efilinux component of grub2, as shipped in Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu. These could be triggered by an extremely large number of arguments to the initrd command on 32-bit architectures, or a crafted filesystem with very large files on any architecture.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "Colin Watson and Chris Coulson discovered that an integer overflow existed in GRUB2 when handling the initrd command, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.",
  "Notes": [

    "sbeattie| code is not upstream in grub2 but carried as part of patches by Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat and possibly others.",
    "amurray| grub2-signed is not supported in Ubuntu 12.04 ESM (precise/esm) and so marking the priority for grub2 in this release as low"
