  "Description": "In PyYAML before 5.1, the yaml.load() API could execute arbitrary code if used with untrusted data. The load() function has been deprecated in version 5.1 and the 'UnsafeLoader' has been introduced for backward compatibility with the function.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "sarnold\u003e The patch changes the incredibly-unsafe yaml.load to the behaviour of safe_load; despite being many years overdue, it's also likely to break something.",
    "mdeslaur\u003e upstream has reverted the 4.1 fix, so as of 2019-02-13, there",
    "mdeslaur\u003e is no proper fix for this issue, and fixing it is likely to",
    "mdeslaur\u003e cause compatibility issues."
