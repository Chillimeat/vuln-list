  "name": "CVE-2016-8867",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Docker Engine 1.12.2 enabled ambient capabilities with misconfigured capability policies. This allowed malicious images to bypass user permissions to access files within the container filesystem or mounted volumes.",
    "An incorrect setting of ambient capabilities caused unprivileged non-root processes inside a container to run with unexpected capabilities, allowing them to escalate their privileges inside that container to root.  When this issue was originally reported in 2016, it did not affect any version of docker packages shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras at that time. \nDue to the regression, the docker-1.13.1-108.git4ef4b30.el7 packages became vulnerable to these privilege escalations within the container.  This specific build is the only one containing the regression, and the only version affected by this issue."
