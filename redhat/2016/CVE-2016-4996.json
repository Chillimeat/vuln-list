    "discovery-debug in Foreman before 6.2 when the ssh service has been enabled on discovered nodes displays the root password in plaintext in the system journal when used to log in, which allows local users with access to the system journal to obtain the root password by reading the system journal, or by clicking Logs on the console.",
    "A flaw was found in discovery-debug in foreman. An attacker, with permissions to view the debug results, would be able to view the root password associated with that system, potentially allowing them to access it."
