    "A flaw was found in BIND, where it does not sufficiently limit the number of fetches that can be performed while processing a referral response. This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service attack. The attacker can also exploit this behavior to use the recursing server as a reflector in a reflection attack with a high amplification factor."
