  "mitigation": "Disabling keep-alive will prevent Tomcat from reading multiple requests from a single TCP connection, and should also prevent Tomcat from handling any request that was smuggled through the proxy in front of it. This can be done via the `maxKeepAliveRequests` configuration setting of the HTTP Connector.\nApache httpd is often used as reverse proxy to enhance the performance of high-load environments. When running Tomcat behind Apache httpd, consider the `disablereuse Off` mod_proxy configuration setting, which can be used to prevent Tomcat from keeping the connection between himself and httpd.",

    "In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99 the HTTP header parsing code used an approach to end-of-line parsing that allowed some invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid. This led to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is considered unlikely.",
    "A flaw was found in Apache Tomcat versions 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50, and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99. The HTTP header parsing code used an approach to end-of-line (EOL) parsing that allowed some invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid. This led to the possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. The highest threat with this vulnerability is system availability."
