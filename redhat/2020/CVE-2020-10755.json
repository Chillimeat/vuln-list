  "statement": "In addition to the software updates for this flaw, you must deploy a new configuration file on compute nodes, cinder nodes, and anywhere you would perform a volume attachment in your deployment. \n## Configuration\nOn each node where Dell EMC Scaleio or VxFlex OS SDC is installed, do the following:\n1. Create the /opt/emc/scaleio/openstack/connector.conf file (if it does not exist):    \n$ mkdir -p /opt/emc/scaleio/openstack\n$ touch /opt/emc/scaleio/openstack/connector.conf\n2. For each scaleio or vxflexos section in cinder.conf, create the same section in the /opt/emc/scaleio/openstack/connector.conf file and populate it with\npasswords. Example:    \n[vxflexos]\nsan_password = SIO_PASSWD\n[vxflexos-new]\nsan_password = SIO2_PASSWD",
