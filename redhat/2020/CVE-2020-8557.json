  "mitigation": "On OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.11 and 4.x it's possible to set the allowPrivilegeEscalation Security Context Constraint to 'false' to prevent this. Note that this is set to 'true' by default, and setting it to false will prevent certain binaries which require setuid to stop working. On OCP 3.11 for example the 'ping' command will no longer work [1]. On OCP 4.x and later the 'ping' command will work with allowPrivilegeEscalation set to False, but other setuid binaries will not work.\n[1] https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/release_notes/ocp_3_11_release_notes.html",
