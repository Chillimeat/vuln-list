  "mitigation": "The most complete workaround is to disable credential helpers altogether:\n~~~\ngit config --unset credential.helper\ngit config --global --unset credential.helper\ngit config --system --unset credential.helper\n~~~\nAn alternative is to avoid malicious URLs:\n1. Examine the hostname and username portion of URLs fed to git clone or git fetch for the presence of encoded newlines (%0A) or syntactic oddities (e.g., http:///host with three slashes).\n2. Avoid using submodules with untrusted repositories (don't use git clone --recurse-submodules; use git submodule update only after examining the URLs found in .gitmodules).\n3. Avoid tools which may run git clone on untrusted URLs under the hood.\n4. Avoid using the credential helper by only cloning publicly available repositories.",
