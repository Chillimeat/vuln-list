  "statement": "By default OpenShift Container Platform uses the OpenShift SDN network interface. This interface makes this attack impractical by implementing IPTable rules on the host side of the virtual network interface, isolating network traffic to within the pod.\nIf OpenShift Container Platform has the sriov-network-operator deployed it would be at greater risk of exploitation.",
