  "statement": "This flaw depends on a direct database connection from the UI, however the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) Web UI only communicates with backend APIs. For this reason, the RHOSP Django package will not be updated.\nThis flaw affects the versions of python-django as shipped with Red Hat Update Infrastructure 3, however the Product is not vulnerable as it does not use GIS functions.\nThe version of python-django shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage was used with calamari and graphite which are no more supported, hence the django package will not be fixed for RHCS.\nThe version of python-django shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage includes the flawed code, but the vulnerable functionality is currently not used by the product and hence this issue has been rated as having a security impact of Low.",

  "details": [
    "Django 1.11 before 1.11.29, 2.2 before 2.2.11, and 3.0 before 3.0.4 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a tolerance parameter in GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle. By passing a suitably crafted tolerance to GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.",
    "A SQL-injection flaw was found in python-django, where GIS functions and aggregates in Oracle did not correctly neutralize tolerance-parameter data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to submit crafted data to inject malicious SQL."
