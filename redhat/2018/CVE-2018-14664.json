  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in foreman from versions 1.18. A stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exists due to an improperly escaped HTML code in the breadcrumbs bar. This allows a user with permissions to edit which attribute is used in the breadcrumbs bar to store code that will be executed on the client side.",
    "A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the foreman component of satellite. An attacker with privilege to create entries using the Hosts, Monitor, Infrastructure, or Administer Menus is able to execute a XSS attacks against other users, possibly leading to malicious code execution and extraction of the anti-CSRF token of higher privileged users."
