    "Git Plugin connects to a user-specified Git repository as part of form validation. An attacker with no direct access to Jenkins but able to guess at a username/password credentials ID could trick a developer with job configuration permissions into following a link with a maliciously crafted Jenkins URL which would result in the Jenkins Git client sending the username and password to an attacker-controlled server.",
    "The Git Plugin can leak credentials (username and password) used to access a git repo if an attacker-supplied URL is provided to the plugin. To supply the URL to the plugin, the attacker would need to guess a username/password ID and then trick a developer into following a specific URL."
