  "details": [
    "X.org libXi 1.7.1 and earlier allows X servers to trigger allocation of insufficient memory and a buffer overflow via vectors related to an unexpected sign extension in the XListInputDevices function.",
    "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the XListInputDevices() function of X.Org X11's libXi runtime library handled signed numbers. A malicious X11 server could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running an X11 client."
