  "details": [
    "The (1) GetDatabase and (2) _XimParseStringFile functions in X.org libX11 1.5.99.901 (1.6 RC1) and earlier do not restrict the recursion depth when processing directives to include files, which allows X servers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption) via a crafted file.",
    "Two stack-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way libX11, the Core X11 protocol client library, processed certain user-specified files. A malicious X11 server could possibly use this flaw to crash an X11 client via a specially crafted file."
