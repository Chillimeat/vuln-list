    "Memory leak in the zlib_stateful_init function in crypto/comp/c_zlib.c in libssl in OpenSSL 0.9.8f through 0.9.8h allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via multiple calls, as demonstrated by initial SSL client handshakes to the Apache HTTP Server mod_ssl that specify a compression algorithm."
